# Restaurant Page

This repository contains a modular, Webpack-bundled restaurant website built entirely with JavaScript DOM manipulation.  
All page content (Home, Menu, Contact) is dynamically generated by modules and rendered into a single `<div id="content">`, enabling a tab-based navigation system without reloading the page.

## Features

### Webpack Setup
- Project initialized with `package.json` and fully configured Webpack bundling.
- Development server enabled via `npx webpack serve`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules` and `dist` as required.
- Modular project structure inside `src/`, including separate modules for each tab.

### Dynamic Page Rendering
- HTML skeleton stored in `src/template.html` and processed by Webpack.
- JavaScript generates all content inside `#content`, including the homepage layout.
- Each tab (“Home”, “Menu”, “Contact”) has its own module exporting a function that:
  - Creates a container element
  - Injects the appropriate text, images, and structure
  - Appends the fully built content to the DOM

### Tab Navigation Logic
- Navigation bar contains buttons (not links) for each tab.
- Clicking a tab:
  - Clears the current content of `#content`
  - Loads the selected module and renders its content
- All tab-switching logic is handled in `index.js`.

### File Overview
- **src/index.js**  
  Entry point for Webpack; imports modules, initializes homepage, manages tab switching.

- **src/home.js**, **src/menu.js**, **src/contact.js**  
  Independent modules exporting functions that construct and return each page’s content.

- **src/template.html**  
  Base HTML with header, nav buttons, and empty `#content` container.

- **webpack.config.js**  
  Webpack configuration for bundling JavaScript and processing the HTML template.

- **dist/**  
  Production build output (ignored by Git).
